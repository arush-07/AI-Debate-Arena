> **A Next-Gen Gamified Debate Simulator built for the Dev Heat IIIT Surat hackathon.**

---

##  About
This project leverages the power of **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** combined with **LangChain** to create a competitive, real-time debate simulator.

The system is designed to gamify critical thinking by pitting users against adaptive AI personas. It processes arguments in real-time, evaluates them using a strictly impartial "AI Judge," and provides instant feedback via a "Health Point" (HP) system. By simulating high-stakes verbal combat, we demonstrate how GenAI can be used for educational reinforcement and logic training.

**Key Features:**
*  **Gamified Combat:** Users and AI have Health Bars; weak logic or irrelevance deals damage.
*  **Adaptive Personas:** Debate against distinct personalities like a "Logical Vulcan" or "Aggressive Troll."
*  **Real-time Judging:** Instant scoring of Logic, Relevance, and Civility for every turn.
*  **Post-Match Analysis:** A comprehensive coaching report generated automatically after the match.

##  Technology Stack
We used a modern tech stack focused on speed, interactivity, and AI reasoning:

* **Core Engine:** [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) (Orchestration & Prompt Chaining)
* **Language:** Python
* **Frontend:** Streamlit
* **AI/LLM:** Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (via API)
* **Validation:** Pydantic (Structured Output Parsing)
